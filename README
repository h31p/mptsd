mptsd
=====
mptsd receives mpegts streams from multicast (udp/rtp) or http and combines
them into one multiple program stream that is suitable for outputing to DVB-C
modulator. It is tested with Dektec DTE-3114 Quad QAM Modulator and it
is used in production in couple of small DVB-C networks.

Installation
============
mptsd do not depend on any external libraries. There are two source code
dependancies that come with mptsd - libfuncs and libtsfuncs.

Make sure your kernel has CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS enabled. Otherwise sleep
timeout probably won't be able to calibrate itself and mptsd will not work.

Documentation
=============
mptsd is controlled using command line parameters. Run mptsd to see all of
the parameters and explanation what every one of them does. Also there
are 4 configuration files. In the distribution there are example files that
you can change to suit your needs.

  mptsd.conf          - This file configures the network_id in outputed
                        NIT table and also MPEG PSI tables playout timeouts.

  mptsd_nit.conf      - Configures NIT table output.

  mptsd_channels.conf - Configure inputs, SDT provider name and transport_stream_id

  mptsd_epg.conf      - Configures EIT current/next tables. This file is auto
                        reloaded when it is changed. This allows EPG in output
                        to work.

One mptsd instance should be used for each transponder.

Output Stream
=============
mptsd can achieve perfect PCR restamping to output using "-m 3".
This is useful for hardware modulators that require correct PCR values
(most cheap modulators do, so always use "-m 3" with them).
mptsd was tested and found to be working ok with Dektec DTE-3114 & HiDes UT-100C.

Development
===========
The development is tracked using git. The repository is hosted at github
to get it, run the following command:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/mptsd.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
     OR
   git submodule update --recursive --remote  // if you like to checkout HEAD submodules.

Compiling
=========
After cloning the git repository as described in Development section
just run `make`.
